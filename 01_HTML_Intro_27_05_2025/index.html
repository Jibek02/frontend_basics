      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals which
      includes the living elephants (belonging to the genera
      
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas">
        <em>Elephas</em>
      </a>  
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant"> 
        <em>Loxodonta</em>
      </a>), as well as a number of extinct
       genera like Mammuthus(mammoths) and Palaeoloxodon. They are large terrestrial mammals with a
     snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most genera and
      species in the family are extinct. The family was first described by John
      Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the
      order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to
      include or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.
